# What is v3-gmaps?

**v3-gmaps** is a component-based [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview) for [Vue](https://v3.vuejs.org), and is the Vue 3 version of [x5-gmaps](https://github.com/xon52/x5-gmaps).

## Improvements Over x5-gmaps

- It uses (and supports) [Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org) which is so much better than Vue 2.
- It is fully typed, and being Vue 3 the Typescript support is way better.
- It has proper ES6 module support, which means you only import what you use.
- It uses the latest Google Maps API, and the flexible Options prop allows for automatic future compatibility.
- It's what will be more actively developed and supported.

## What are the future plans?

- Find contributors - we need a community to keep this active and remove any owner bottlenecks.
- Add other language support (e.g. Chinese).
- Add Data layer support (the only x5-gmaps feature that's missing).
- Expand support for other Google Maps API's.
