# Polyline (`gmaps-polyline`) & Polygon (`gmaps-polygon`)

<div class="v3-gmaps-screenshot">
  <img src="../img/polyline.png">
  <p>In addition to <a href="./shapes.md">circles and rectangles</a>, you can also create polylines and polygons on a map.</p>
</div>

### Simple Use ([demo](https://vue-bujcvu.stackblitz.io/polylines))

```html
<template>
  <div style="height: 500px">
    <gmaps-map>
      <gmaps-polyline :path="[{ lat: -28, lng: 125 }, { lat: -25, lng: 130 }, { lat: -32, lng: 120 }]" />
      <gmaps-polygon :paths="[[{ lat: -28, lng: 125 }, { lat: -25, lng: 130 }, { lat: -32, lng: 120 }]]" />
    </gmaps-map>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { defineComponent } from 'vue';
import { gmapsMap, gmapsPolyline, gmapsPolygon } from 'v3-gmaps';

export default defineComponent({
  components: { gmapsMap, gmapsPolyline, gmapsPolygon },
});
</script>
```

# Polyline (`gmaps-polyline`)

::: tip
`gmaps-polyline` has most of the [properties and events Google Maps' Polyline](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/polygon#Polyline) has.

| radius    |       `number`       |    -    | The radius in meters on the Earth's surface.                                                                       |

### Events

| Event          |      Type       | Description                                                             |
| :------------- | :-------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| center_changed | `GmapsPosition` | This event is fired when the circle's center is changed.                |
| click          | `GmapsPosition` | This event is fired when the DOM click event is fired on the Circle.    |
| dblclick       | `GmapsPosition` | This event is fired when the DOM dblclick event is fired on the Circle. |
| drag           | `GmapsPosition` | This event is repeatedly fired while the user drags the Circle.         |
| dragend        | `GmapsPosition` | This event is fired when the user stops dragging the Circle.            |
| dragstart      | `GmapsPosition` | This event is fired when the user starts dragging the Circle.           |
| mousedown      | `GmapsPosition` | This event is fired for a mousedown on the Circle.                      |
| mousemove      | `GmapsPosition` | This event is fired for a mousedown on the Circle.                      |
| mouseout       | `GmapsPosition` | This event is fired when the mouse leaves the area of the Circle.       |
| mouseover      | `GmapsPosition` | This event is fired when the mouse enters the area of the Circle.       |
| mouseup        | `GmapsPosition` | This event is fired for a mouseup on the Circle.                        |
| radius_changed |    `number`     | This event is fired when the circle's radius is changed.                |
| rightclick     | `GmapsPosition` | This event is fired for a rightclick on the Circle.                     |

### Notes

- There is no `contextmenu` event for the circle ðŸ˜¢
- The circle is geodesic which means it projects itself on the map as if it is on a globe. You can see these effects by dragging a circle far North or South.


# Rectangle (`gmaps-rectangle`)

::: tip
`gmaps-rectangle` has most of the [properties and events Google Maps' Rectangle](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/polygon#Rectangle) has.
